# Personality Test

Website that tests the personality of users

This is a modification of the AutoDoc project, still under construction. It currently works on a streamlit website, and is connected to a supabase PostgreSQL database. The idea is to implement OpenAI agents and process the test results with it.

Make sure you follow the list of requirements.

Informational

    This moral personality test was started on a whim, in a mix of two different desires:
    for one, I wanted to think more about morally difficult questions, and try to solidify my thoughts and morality; and secondly, I wanted to share it with others, to incentivize people to understand more about how they think and why. The results have been interesting so far, and perhaps I will disclose them somehow, sometime.
